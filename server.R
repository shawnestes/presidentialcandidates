    <br><br>Perry was the longest serving governor in Texas state history. As a result, he was the only governor in modern Texas history to have appointed at least one person to every eligible state office, board, or commission position (as well as to several elected offices to which the governor can appoint someone to fill an unexpired term, such as six of the nine current members of the Texas Supreme Court).
    <br><br>Perry was elected to full gubernatorial terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010 and is the fourth Texas governor (after Allan Shivers, Price Daniel and John Connally) to serve three terms. With a tenure in office of 14 years, 30 days, Perry was, at the time he left office, the second longest serving current U.S. governor (after Terry Branstad of Iowa).

    <br><br>Sanders is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history. A self-described democratic socialist,[6][7][8][9] he favors policies similar to those of social democratic parties in Europe, particularly those instituted by the Nordic countries.[10][11][12] He caucuses with the Democratic Party and has been the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee since January 2015.[13]    
    <br><br>Born in Brooklyn, New York, Sanders is a graduate of the University of Chicago. While a student, he was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and an active Civil Rights protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.[14][15] In 1963, he participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
    <br><br>After settling in Vermont in 1968, Sanders ran unsuccessful third party campaigns for Governor and U.S. Senator in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent, Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont's most populous city, in 1981.

    <br><br>Sanders is known as a leading progressive voice on issues such as income inequality,[7] universal healthcare, parental leave, climate change,[16] LGBT rights, and campaign finance reform.[17] He rose to national prominence following his 2010 filibuster[18][19] against the proposed extension of the Bush tax cuts. He is also outspoken on civil rights and civil liberties, and has been particularly critical of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act,[20] as well as racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. He has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy, and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War.

She served as a United States Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009.    
<br><br>An Illinois native, Hillary Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969, where she became the first student commencement speaker, then earned her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1973. After a stint as a Congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas, marrying Bill Clinton in 1975. She co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families in 1977, became the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978, and was named the first female partner at Rose Law Firm in 1979. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. While First Lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992, she led a task force that reformed Arkansas' education system, while sitting on the board of directors of Wal-Mart, among other corporations.
<br><br>As First Lady of the United States, her major initiative, the Clinton health care plan of 1993, failed to reach a vote in Congress. In 1997 and 1999, she played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act and the Foster Care Independence Act. The only First Lady to have been subpoenaed, she testified before a federal grand jury in 1996 regarding the Whitewater controversy, although no charges against her related to this or other investigations during her husband's presidency were ever brought. Her marriage to the president was subject to considerable public discussion following the Lewinsky scandal of 1998, and overall her role as First Lady drew a polarized response from the American public.
<br><br>After moving to New York, Clinton was elected in 2000 as the first female senator from the state, the first and so far only First Lady ever to have sought elected office. Following the September 11 attacks, she voted for and supported military action in Afghanistan and the Iraq Resolution, but subsequently objected to the George W. Bush administration's conduct of the Iraq War, as well as most of Bush's domestic policies. Clinton was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for the Democratic nomination in the 2008 presidential election, Clinton won more primaries and delegates than any other female candidate in American history, but ultimately lost the nomination to Obama.
<br><br>As Secretary of State in the Obama administration from January 2009 to February 2013, Clinton was at the forefront of the U.S. response to the Arab Spring and advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She took responsibility for security lapses related to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which resulted in the deaths of American consulate personnel, but defended her personal actions in regard to the matter. Clinton visited more countries than any other Secretary of State. She viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values, by combining military power with diplomacy and American capabilities in economics, technology, and other areas. She encouraged empowerment of women everywhere and used social media to communicate the U.S. message abroad. Leaving office at the end of Obama's first term, she authored her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements before announcing her second run for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 presidential election.
